First Repository for FreeCodeCamp.
Hi.  I'm in the midst of a career change from horticulture to logistics.  The skillset set I developed as a gardener has limited use in my new field.  I'm now with a fortune 500 company learning how a package delivery system executes in a global economy and I'm looking to continue diversifying my skills through coding to continue growth through my career change and into my new career.
